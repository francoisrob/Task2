# Task2

The first form generates a user set amount of unique records and saves it into a CSV file. 
It makes use of 20 set names and surnames in 2 seperate arrays. The dates are chosen randomly.
The program then makes use of a hash table to check each new value if a duplicate of it exists and appends
it to the file if no duplicate was found. The file is then saved into a seperate output folder.

The import button allows the user to choose a valid CSV file to upload. The program then uploads all of
the records into a new database file located in a new db folder.
